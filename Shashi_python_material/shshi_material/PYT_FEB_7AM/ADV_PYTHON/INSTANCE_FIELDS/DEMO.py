Instance Fields :
    - The variables which are declared
    with in the class with self

    - For Instance Fields memory is allocated
    with in the object.

    - Every instance field must be referred by "self"
    throughout the class.

    - Every instance field must be referred by an
    object reference whenever u want access it from
    outside of the class.

    - For Every instance field an individual memory
    blocks are created in every new object of the same
    class. thus changing the value of an instance field
    in one object will not effected to the same instance field
    in another object of the same class.
