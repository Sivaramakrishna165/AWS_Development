    x=10
    y=20
    z=x+y   #int + int ==> int | Sum

    x="Sai"
    y="Baba"
    z=x+y # str + str -> str | concatenation

    10 * 2 --> 20
    "sai "* 2 --> sai sai

By Using
  1. Method Overloading
      - In Other Languages
            Method overloading is the process of defining
            more than one method with same name for
            different purpose.            
  
  2. Constructor Overloading
        - In Other Languages
             constructor overloading is the process of defining
             more than one constructor for different purpose.

  3. Method Overriding
         - Methods are inherited
         - Process of defining the sub class method
                   exactly same as super class methods
        - It is possible in only is-a relationship

      IQ: When do i go for method overriding ?
      Ans: Whenever u want use the super class method
      into the subclass with different implementation.
  
  4. Constructor Overriding
       - constructors are also inherited
       - defining the sub class constructor same as
       super class constructor called constructor
       over
