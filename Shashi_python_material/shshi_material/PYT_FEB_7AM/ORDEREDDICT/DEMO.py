dict vs OrderedDict

- dict is unordered collection
   where insertion order of the items
   are not maintained

- OrderedDict is Ordered Collection i.e
insertion order of the items are maintained.

- we can create dict  object by using dict( )
or dict(iterable)

- we can create OrderedDict object by using
OrderedDict( ) from collections module.

import collections
od=collections.OrderedDict()

Note: All the methods of dict are used in the OrderedDict
