Bitwise Operator
   Bitwise operators are used to
   perform the operations only on binary digits [bits]
       0's and 1's

x=10 ---> 1 0 1 0
y=11 ---> 1 0 1 1

bitwise and &
    - will work as same as logical and 1-True 0-False
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1
-----------
1 0 1 0
print(x&y) #10

bitwise or |
   - work same as logical or
   
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1
-----------
1 0 1 1
print(x|y) #11

bitwise xor
   - When both bits are different then will return 1 else 0

1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1
-----------
0 0 0 1
print(x^y) #1
