Data types
   - Languages are classified into 2 types
        - Statically typed languages
               Eg: C, C++, Java, . net
               
        - Dynamically typed  Languages
               Eg: JavaScript | ShellScript | Python.

In Python:
    1.Value Types
          - It can store a value.
              Eg: Number Types
                       int | float | complex
                    
              Non Number Types
                       None | bool  
              
    2.Collection Types
          - Used to store group of values
          - Predefined Data Structures | Seq |  iterables
          Eg:   str | list | tuple | set | dict ......          
          
    3.Binary Types
         - Used to store the binary values
         - Mostly used for Media Related Files
                 Images | Audios | V.
                     Eg:  bytes | bytearray

   Note: > Every Data in Python is a class.
              > In Python Every thing will be stored in the
                 form an object [ Memory block ].

    Object are classified into 2 types
       1.mutable object
       
       2.immutable object
           Eg: Number Types | int | float | complex
                                                        str | tuple | bool
    * Objects are dynamic in size
         Thus in Python There is no ranges and Sizes
         for data types.

Int Data type:
    > Predefined class for int type <class 'int'>
    > If any variable is assigned with +ve or -ve
    number without decimal value are treated by
    the system as int type.

    x=10
    x=-123


float data type:
        > predefined class for float type is <class 'float'>
        > If any variable is assigned with a +VE|-VE
        with decimal then they are treated by PVM
        as float

        Eg:   x=12.12
        y=-12.12121212
        z=1.2e2
        a=1.2E3

complex type:
        > Predefined class for complex type is
        <class 'complex'>

        >In Maths complex Rep by using a+ib or
                                                                      a+bi                                                                      
          a rep real part | where b rep imag part
                       i rep under SQRT -1

         > In Python we have to rep by using (a+bj)
                  j Rep under SQRT of -1

        > real and imag values can be either of type
        int or float,but internally they works as float


        x=10+20j


None Type:
     C-Language:
             #include<stdio.h>
             int x;    //GBV
             x=NULL;

        Java:
             String s="James";
             s=null;

        In Python :
                  x=10
                  x=None
             
IQ: None vs del

bool type:
  * Predefined class
       for bool type is <class 'bool'>
