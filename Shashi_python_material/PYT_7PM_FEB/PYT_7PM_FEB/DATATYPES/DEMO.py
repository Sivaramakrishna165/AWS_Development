  *  Data types
       Variables dynamically typed

  * In Python
       Data types  are 3 types
           1.Value types
                - can store a value.
                     Number Types :  int | float | complex                             
                      Non Number Types : bool | None
                      del keyword
                      NameError
                
           2.Collection types | predefined DS |
                                     sequences | iterables
                 - group of values
                             Eg:   str | list | tuple | set | dict .....
                             
           3.Binary Types
                 - type can store binary information
                       Used For images , Object , AF | VF
                              Eg:  bytes | bytearray
      
   * Every Data in python is a class .
   
   * In Python Memory Every thing will be stored
                 in the form of an object | object is nothingbut                 
                 its a memory block.

   * In Python Every Object is dynamic thus there
     no sizes and ranges for data types.

         For Eg in C-Language:
                signed int  | 2 bytes | range : -32,768 to 32,767
                unsigned int | 2 bytes | range : 0 to 65535

   * Objects are classified into 2 types
          1.mutable object
          2.Immutable objects
               Eg:  number types int | float |complex
                                                       str | tuple | bool

   Value Types :
       Number Types
            int
              - predefined class for int type <class 'int'>
              - if any variable is assigend with a number
                  without decimal then that variable is considered
                  as int type
                               It may be +ve or -ve

                    Eg:  x=10
                            y=-123
                            z=348934893489384938493489

                            ============================

        float data type:
              > if any variable which is assigned with
              any number with decimal values are treated
              by PVM as float

              > predefined class for float <class 'float'>

              x=12.12
              y=-12.12121212
              x=9834938493849834983948934.12

              a=1.2e2              
              b=1.2E3

=======================================
Complex Type:
    > Predefined class for complex <class 'complex'>
    > complex numbers are rep by
                             (a+ib) --> (a+bi)

                             a rep real part
                             b rep imag part
                             i rep under SQRT -1

In Python complex numbers are rep by using
     (a+bj)   j rep under SQRT -1

     > Both real and imag values can be either of
     type int or float,But internally it will treated
     them as float type.

bool type:
    > if any variable which is assigned
            with True or False
            treated by PVM as  bool type

    > <class 'bool'>        

====================================
None Type:

    In C-Language
          int x;
          printf("%d",x); GBV
          x=NULL;

    In Java:
           x=null;
===========================
In Python
   x=10
   x=None

   del vs None
   



     





                             
              
                    


                  
 str datatype
    - predefined class for str is <class 'str'>
    - In Python there is no char type
                   In C and Java
                     char sname='x';

    - In Python any thing is written in between
          'shashi' | "shashi" | ''' shashi ''' | """ shashi """

    - In Python string data will be stored in the form
         of an array

    - In Python Array Index values 2 types
              +ve index values
                   from o to n-1 always from left to right
                   
              -ve index values
                  from -1 to -n always from right to left
