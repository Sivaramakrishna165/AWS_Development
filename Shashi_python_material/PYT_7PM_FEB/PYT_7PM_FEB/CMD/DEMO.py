Command line arguments
   - Process of passing the values to the
   prg by the time of execution along with
   program name through command prompt

   - we can pass n no.of. argument and any type of
   argument but each value should be sep by space

   - While passing the string data it should be
   taken between ' ' or " "

   - All the command line arguments are treated by
   the system as strings only

   - All the command arguments are stored in the
   argv variable of type <class list> from sys module.

   - argv[0] always holds the prg name
   
   - from argv[1]....argv[n] will have command line
   arguments.
