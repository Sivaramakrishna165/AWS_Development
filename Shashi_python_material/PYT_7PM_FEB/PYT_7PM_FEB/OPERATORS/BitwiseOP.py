Bitwise Operator
  are used to perform the operations
  only on binary digits [ bits]
  
      D  ==> Binary
x=10  ==> 1010  
y=11  ==> 1011

 bitwise and &
      - will work as same as logical and 1-True 0-False
        x & y
      1 0 1 0
      1 0 1 1
     ------------
      1  0 1 0
      =======
      print(x&y) --> 10
 
 bitwise or
      - Will work as same as logical or
              x | y
           1 0 1 0
           1 0 1 1
           -----------
           1 0 1 1 --> 11
           print(x|y) --> 11



           


           
      


 
 bitwise xor
 bitwise Left shift
 bitwise Right shift
